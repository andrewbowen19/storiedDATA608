    "## Introduction\n",
    "Inflation and its economic effects have been in the news recently. The Fed's goal has been to curb inflation (the general rise in the price of goods and services) and maintain a [low unemployment rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp) -- the number of active job-seekers out of work. [The Phillips Curve](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Economics_(Boundless)/23%3A_Inflation_and_Unemployment/23.1%3A_The_Relationship_Between_Inflation_and_Unemployment#:~:text=The%20Phillips%20curve%20shows%20the%20inverse%20trade%2Doff%20between%20rates,low%2C%20inflation%20will%20be%20high.) is an economic principle stating the general negative relationship between these two variables. Simply put, economies with higher inflation tend to have lower unemployment, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Reserve (Fed) is central bank of the United States, and is tasked with leveraging monetary policy to curb both these factors. This means the Fed can face the difficult choice of *either* reducing inflation *or* curbing unemployment. The main way the Fed can do this is via monetary policy, or the control of interest rates, which in theory can impact the amount of spending & investingment in an economy. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, has stated a goal of accomplishing both these goals, something that the Phillips curve states is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this RMarkdown notebook we'll take a look at interest rate, unemployment, and inflation data to see if the Fed has accomplished these goals. \n",
