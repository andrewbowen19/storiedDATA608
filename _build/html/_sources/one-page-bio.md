Hi all,

My name is Andrew Bowen. The best way to contact me is via my CUNY email (andrew.bowen08@spsmail.cuy.edu).
I currently work as a data engineer at Jacobs. I have 5 years experience programming in python, and 1 year with R, Scala, and JavaScript. I'm personally most comfortable with python but excited to learn other languages!
I've worked with some geographic data before (mostly via GeoJSON and the python geopandas library), but don't have extensive experience.
For my career, I want to keep progressing along the data engineering route - I've found that I still get to do tasks more in the realm of "data science", but also get to see "how the sausage is made." Data visualization is a passion of mine, so I'm really looking forward to exploring that more in depth in this class. When I'm not coding, you can find me running, reading, or climbing 🏃🏼‍♂️📚🧗🏼

Looking forward to this course and working with you all!
